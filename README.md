# THIS CODE IS OUTDATED AND USES SHITTY FILE GLUING METHODS. I RECOMMEND USING https://github.com/GuFFy12/Discord-Token-Checker CHECK AND PARSE TOKENS!
Parse discord tokens from any file, even if there is other shit in the file with them.

Any. File. I glued together all html from the archives of tokenlogged users in discord, and the parser took the tokens from THEIR webhook tokenloggerðŸ˜®
